		<p>A coalition of 15 local nonprofits working to improve the lives of drug addicts said New York City could cut down on fatal overdoses by becoming the first place in the country to provide safe places for users to shoot up.</p>

		<p>Unintentional overdoses from heroin more than doubled in recent years, from 209 per 100,000 residents in 2010 to 423 in 2013, according to the most recent data available from the New York City Department of Health.</p>

		<p>Just over 19,000 heroin users in New York City sought treatment in 2012, and opioids were involved in 71 percent of unintentional drug-poisoning deaths in the city in 2013, with 97 percent of these deaths involving more than one substance, per the National Institute on Drug Abuse report "Drug Use Trends in New York City: 2013."</p>

		<p>Safe injection facilities are dedicated places where addicts can go to shoot up in safe and hygienic environments that provide clean needles, sharps containers, information on rehabilitation programs and medical staff on hand to intervene in case of an accidental overdose. At a meeting on Sept. 30, 2015 at the Unitarian Church of All Souls on the Upper East Side to promote these facilities, social service advocates said the city would further benefit from fewer users shooting up in streets, parks or public restrooms.</p>

		<p>"There's a schizophrenic relationship with how our government deals with drugs. One arm of the state spends millions on needle exchange, and another confiscates them and arrests people," said Matt Curtis, policy director at Vocal New York, which advocates for low-income New Yorkers affected by drug laws and is a member of the coalition named SIF NYC. "It's tough to promote an approach we know works."</p>

		<p>Needle exchange locations are a natural place where safe injection facilities could exist, said Robert Suarez, 52, northern Manhattan community organizer for Vocal New York.</p> 

		<p>"While not official SIFs, there are places where people can come and use a bathroom," said Suarez, who lost his mother to an overdose in 2000. "Now, we don't know what they do in those bathrooms, but there are protocols set up, such as having a 15-minute time limit. And those protocols have saved lives. We've had a number of OD reversals."</p>
